The Kroxylicious project is very pleased to announce the [0.8.0](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-junit5-extension/releases/tag/v0.8.0) release of our Junit5 Extension which corrects an issue that prevented test authors utilising Junit 5.0 [Test Templates](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-test-templates) in consort with the features from the Kroxylicious Junit Extension such as `@BrokerCluster`.   There are also depenedency updates as part of the release.

Further details about controlling the Kafka Cluster such as enabling KRaft support are can be found in the projects [readme](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-junit5-extension).

Please let us know, through [Slack](https://kroxylicious.slack.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious-junit5-extension/issues), if you find the extension interesting or helpful.
