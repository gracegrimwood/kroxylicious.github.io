Kroxylicious is a Java application based on [Netty](https://netty.io/), which means it will run anywhere you can run a JVM. (That's a lot of places!)
To keep things simple, we've created a quick setup guide to help.

<br />

## Getting started

#### Prerequisites

To get started deploying Kroxylicious, you will need to install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with minimum version 17, this does not come included with the Kroxylicious JAR files.
Some operating systems come with a JRE already installed. You can check what Java version you have installed by running the following command:

```shell
java -version
```

If you get an error or the command doesn't return anything, you may not have a JRE installed, or your JRE may not have been correctly added to your `PATH` variable.

#### Installing Kroxylicious

```java
// Hm. We don't seem to have any executable artifacts that we release, so people are going to have to build the whole project themselves just to run it. That's not great.
```
